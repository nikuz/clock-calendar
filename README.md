# Hardware google calendar + clock

[Simulation](https://nikuz.github.io/clock-calendar/)

Capturing a clear photo of this device while it's on is challenging. The bright light of the LEDs messes with the phone's camera, causing the digits and event indicators to appear blurry. It looks much clearer and more impressive in person. Here's the best side view I managed to capture.
